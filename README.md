# Simple Timer

Simple Timer counts down time in seconds as long as it is in foreground. When the counter drops below 10 its color changes into red. There is a button for adding 10 more seconds to the counter and another to stop and restore the countdown. It was developed as an exercise of *application lifcycle*. <br />
